#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains 4x1 multiplexer and 1x4 de-multiplexer.The user can verify the outputs at all possible combination of inputs for each select line respectively. The user can also verify its result for each circuit by checking the combinations entered by the user.
